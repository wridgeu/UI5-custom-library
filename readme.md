# UI5 Library Playground

This is a playground repository for learning (learning-by-doing) and understanding UI5 libraries. To be more specific custom UI5 control and theme libraries.

When creating this monorepository I have looked through several resources mainly [@vobus](https://github.com/vobu) [ui5-webcomponent-showcase](https://github.com/vobu/ui5-webcomponents-showcase). As this is the first real monorepository of mine it was a bit of a learning curve but I enjoyed it.

In a few examples from [@vobu](https://github.com/vobu) or [@matz3](https://github.com/matz3/) you can see them use yarn (for workspace linking) and it works quite well. If you're unsure whether or not the UI5 tooling is picking up on your dependencies, execute the `ui5 tree` command and check if your dependency gets picked up.

I'm well aware that it does look a bit like a copy of [@vobus](https://github.com/vobu) showcase repository (it isn't, I actually created the files myself ðŸ‘€). I used it as main example and wanted to learn not only [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) but also [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) and the combination of [ui5 webcomponents](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/) with [ui5 custom controls](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/8dcab0011d274051808f959800cabf9f) and [ui5 custom libraries](https://github.com/SAP/openui5/blob/dc225e1c87bcdfe64e6c67972f6a7bd561cc00d7/docs/controllibraries.md). Of course ... mainly the library part but it was the mixture of everything combined that made it enjoyable to learn. In addition to that it was the first time using "basic" things like `npm-watch`. Sounds basic? What can I say, I didn't know it exists and mainly develop in ABAP during the daytime. ðŸ˜‚

## Other ways of getting external resources working in your application

- For example using the `resourceRoots` attribute within the `manifest.json` or `index.html` file. This is especially then useful when you added the external library/dependency as actual files into your application folder (e.g. actually creating a `thirdparty` folder and putting the files in there).

- Another option of adding external (non-UI5, 3rd party) dependencies would be via the usage of [Project-Shims](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/extensibility/ProjectShims/) in tandem to adding the dependencies to the `package.json` as seen in this [example](https://github.com/matz3/ui5con20-ui5-tooling/blob/master/demo-project/packages/library/ui5.yaml) in addition to the usage of the [`sap.ui.loader.config`](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/api/sap.ui.loader#overview) to provide a Runtime-Shim before your actual `sap.ui.require` statement (to not pollute global scope at dev-time)as seen [here](https://github.com/matz3/ui5con20-ui5-tooling/blob/master/demo-project/packages/library/src/ui5con20/library/Chart.js) or [here](https://github.com/SAP/openui5/blob/master/src/sap.ui.codeeditor/src/sap/ui/codeeditor/CodeEditor.js#L5-L23).

# Using this Repository

## Initialize the Repository

The wrapper commands mentioned here are all to be run within the root of the repository. Alternatively you can of course directly run the wrapped commands each inside their respective project folders.

```sh
# Setup the repository within the root and do all the dependency linking.

$> yarn
```

## Building the Library Resources

```bash
# The UI5 application pulls the library resources from the `dist` folder.
# In order to make that work, we first need to build our resources.
# To do so execute the following scripts:

$> yarn ctrllib:build 

# or

$> yarn themelib:build
```

## Developing a Library

```bash
# In order to not have to manually rebuild the libraries after each change use:

$> yarn ctrllib:dev

# or

$> yarn themelib:dev
```

## Starting or Building the UI5 Application

```bash
# The UI5 applications helps to demonstrate the consumption of the libraries.
# You can either run it in development mode or build it and run it from the `dist` folder. 
# Either way, make sure to have the libraries it consumes built first.

# To just start the application use:
$> yarn ui:start:dev

# To build both libraries and start the application use:
$> yarn ui:init:start:dev

# Run the build process of both libraries and the aplication & start the built application:
$> yarn ui:init:start:build
```

# Question & Answer

## Q: Why are there different `.yaml` files in the folders?

> The `ui5.yaml` is the file that gets pulled in (read) by the UI5 tooling. In there we specify which resources we want the UI5 tooling to use. Those are the final, built resources (the ones you'd share via npm for example). While the `ui5-dev.yaml` is being used to create the library or application build.

## Q: Why do we need rollup.js in the control library?

> Someone has to resolve the ES6 modules for us and pre-bundle them so they're ready for consumption via UI5. Ever tried using ES6 modules without a bundler? Check out this [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/12/30/using-ui5-web-components-without-any-framework) by [@christian](https://github.com/christianp86). For already build/bundled (non ES6) assets we can use Project-Shims, as mentioned earlier.

## Q: Is a <Control>Renderer.js file necessary?

> Generally speaking it isn't. It does however make the library more readable and clearly seperated. Head over to [ui5-webcomponent-showcase](https://github.com/vobu/ui5-webcomponents-showcase) for a more elaborate example repository.

## Q: How does the yarn linking (workspace) work?

> It only works for private packages so you have to define the `private` attribute in all of your `package.json` files. Having done that, you define the `workspace` attribute in the root of your poject. After that you should be all set and just typing in `yarn` should do the trick for ya.

## Q: Why are the project-, module- and application IDs so ... weird?

> Well... I suck at naming things. ðŸ˜‚

## Q: Is the `.library` file necessary for a library?

> I wouldn't say so. It is one way for the UI5 tooling to retrieve information (for e.g. the build process) about your project but It's not necessary. The UI5 tooling mainly takes it's information from the `manifest.json` file. In case you don't have a `manifest.json` but a `.library` file, the tooling will pull needed information from the `.library` file and generate a `.manifest.json` file during the build process for you.

# Thanks!

I really highly appreciate all the examples out there. Sadly a lot of information regarding libraries are quite outdated so some of it can feel a bit of detective work, especially when you want to get it "right". Therefore I linked lots of resources that I used right below ðŸ”½ðŸ”½. I'm definitely not saying that I'm currently doing it right, there is lots of room for improvement - don't get me wrong. â˜º
